# animal-soundboard
Meows &amp; Moos is an interactive soundboard game for kids (and fun-loving adults!). Press any letter from A to Z â€” and hear the animal that matches the letter! This project was created as part of my learning journey through the Angela Yu Web Development Bootcamp, where I expanded on the keyboard game idea with animal sounds and visuals.
