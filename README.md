# animal-soundboard-Meows-&-Moos

**Meows &amp; Moos** is an interactive soundboard game for kids (and fun-loving adults!). Press any letter from A to Z — and hear the animal that matches the letter! This project was created as part of my learning journey through the Angela Yu Web Development Bootcamp, where I expanded on the keyboard game idea with animal sounds and visuals.
